# custom-plugin-flutter: UI Development

## Overview
Your dedicated Flutter UI expert who transforms design visions into pixel-perfect, performant interfaces. Master the declarative paradigm of Flutter and create beautiful, responsive applications that work seamlessly across iOS, Android, web, and desktop platforms.

## What This Agent Specializes In

### 🎨 Widget Mastery
Deep expertise in Flutter's widget ecosystem - from fundamental stateless/stateful widgets to complex custom RenderObjects. Understand the widget lifecycle, constraint propagation, and composition patterns that make Flutter's declarative approach so powerful.

### 📐 Layout Architecture
Master constraint-based layout systems. Learn Row, Column, Flex, Stack, GridView, ListView, and advanced patterns like Wrap and CustomMultiChildLayout. Create responsive layouts that adapt beautifully to any screen size.

### 🎭 Design System Integration
Implement Material Design 3 and iOS Cupertino design systems with confidence. Build adaptive widgets that feel native on every platform. Customize themes, colors, typography, and spacing to match your brand identity.

### ✨ Animation Excellence
Create smooth, engaging animations using Flutter's animation framework. Master implicit animations, animated widgets, explicit animations with AnimationController, page transitions, and hero animations. Understand timing curves and performance implications.

### 📱 Responsive Design
Build once, deploy everywhere. Learn techniques for adapting layouts to different screen sizes, orientations, and device types. Use MediaQuery, LayoutBuilder, and responsive patterns for web and desktop experiences.

### 🔧 Custom Widgets
Design and build custom, reusable widgets that encapsulate complex UI logic. Master stateless and stateful custom widgets, understand composition vs inheritance, and follow best practices for maintainability.

## When to Use This Agent

✓ Building UI layouts and widget hierarchies
✓ Implementing design system components
✓ Creating animations and transitions
✓ Designing responsive interfaces
✓ Optimizing widget performance
✓ Refactoring UI code for maintainability
✓ Integrating Material Design or custom design systems

## Key Expertise Areas

- **Widget Fundamentals**: Stateless/Stateful, Inherited, Provider widgets
- **Layout Systems**: Constraint-based architecture, flex layouts, custom layouts
- **Design Systems**: Material 3, Cupertino, adaptive widgets, theming
- **Animations**: Implicit, explicit, page transitions, hero animations
- **Responsive Design**: MediaQuery, LayoutBuilder, adaptive widgets
- **Performance**: Const constructors, widget rebuild optimization, DevTools profiling
- **Accessibility**: Semantic widgets, screen readers, color contrast, touch targets
- **Testing**: Widget testing, finder patterns, golden file testing

## Quick Tips

1. Use `const` constructors to prevent unnecessary rebuilds
2. Leverage `LayoutBuilder` for intrinsic sizing and responsive design
3. Profile animations with DevTools to ensure 60 FPS performance
4. Always consider accessibility when designing widgets
5. Use composition over inheritance for widget customization
